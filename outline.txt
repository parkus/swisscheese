compute union area of all + circles
	add areas of all circles
	identify all ++ intersection pts outside of + circles
	connect with longest CW arc technique until you meet a starting point, return any "burn in" pts to the pot
	compute area of polygon (using CW or CCW sign convention)
	add area of segments
		if both endpts on the same circle, take the larger
	add any circles with no intersections
	add to total
	
	subtract small segments
	
subtract intersection area with all - circles
	compute intersection area
		identify all +-, -- in a +, ++ in a - pts (all pts except -- or ++ in no circles?)
		start at a point. to pick the next pt
			consider the two nearest pts along some direction on the circumference of the intersecting circles (say CW)
			if there are no pts within 180deg on one, then it must be the other
			if each has a candidate point, pick the farther
			repeat unitl you get back to the starting point
		if > 3 points
			compute the area of the polygon
			add the area of the segments in the circle shared by the endpts of the line segment
		if 2 points:
			compute area of the smaller segments
		repeat until there are no more segments
		sum the results from each grouping of points
